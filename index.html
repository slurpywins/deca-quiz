                question: "A corporation is considering issuing a new series of bonds to finance expansion. The CFO needs to determine how quickly the company can expect to recoup the initial investment in the project. Which of the following capital investment analysis methods would be most appropriate?",
                options: [
                    "Internal rate of return",
                    "Payback period",
                    "Discounted break-even",
                    "Net present value"
                ],
                correctAnswer: "B",
                explanation: "The payback period is the time required to recoup the funds expended in an investment. Since the CFO specifically needs to determine how quickly the company can expect to recoup the initial investment, the payback period is the most appropriate method. While the other methods (IRR, NPV, and discounted break-even) are valuable for investment analysis, they don't directly answer the specific question about time to recoup the investment."

                explanation: "Diversification is a risk management strategy that involves spreading investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographic regions to reduce exposure to any single risk. The primary goal is to minimize the impact of poor performance in any one investment on the overall portfolio."

                explanation: "Technical analysis involves studying patterns in stock price movements using charts and statistical indicators to predict future price movement.

                correctAnswer: "B",
                explanation: "A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders. It represents a return on investment for shareholders and is typically paid in cash, although it can also be distributed as additional shares."

                explanation: "Growth stocks in emerging markets typically carry the highest risk among the given options due to factors such as political instability, currency risk, less regulated markets, economic volatility, and potentially less established companies.

Given total liabilities of $500,000 and total shareholders' equity of $250,000, the debt-to-equity ratio is $500,000 ÷ $250,000 = 2.0. This means the company has $2 of debt for every $1 of equity."
